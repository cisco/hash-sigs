/*
 * This is a statistical test of the HSS signatures.
 * Now, we're not questioning the statistical properties of SHA-256.  However,
 * SHA-256 has one statistical "failing", identical inputs will result in
 * identical outputs (actually, the entire HBS process depends on this, so
 * it's not really that serious of a failing).  So, what we're doing is
 * looking for duplicate hashes, which would imply duplicate inputs (or a
 * hash collision, which is *real* unlikely), which would imply a weakness.
 * Now, the LMS scheme mandates that the hash inputs are distinct, except in
 * three cases:
 * - The OTS private keys
 * - The I values
 * - The C randomizer (the part that is hashed along with the message)
 * Repeating OTS private keys is *BAD*, as it would give enough information
 * for an attacker to forge.  Repeating I values or C randomizers isn't nearly
 * as bad, it'd just reduce the security margin (in the case of I, allow
 * multitarget attacks; actually, the security proof accounts for it, however
 * it really shouldn't happen in the relatively small number of keys we use),
 * in the case of C, well, actually, collisions aren't an issue;
 * predictability is (and having a higher-than-expected collision probability
 * would make things predictable). Neither of these latter two would actually
 * be the end of the world, but they shouldn't happen; we might as well throw
 * those as well (especially since it makes the test easier).
 *
 * So, what we do is collect a series of signatures, and see if they contain
 * any duplicated hashes
 *
 * Also, when we're doing a multilevel HSS scheme, two different signatures
 * from the same Merkle level will contain the same upper level hashes (from
 * common aux path), we deliberately make sure we sample from different top
 * level signatures (and keep the same bottom level indexes; if there's a
 * problem there, this would show it up)
