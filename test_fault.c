/*
 * This will test out the protection against fault attacks.  This LMS
 * implementation recomputes the same hash multiple times (both between
 * reloads and within a single reload cycle).
 * One concern is that if we were to miscompute such a hash one of those
 * times (and so miscompute the public key), we might end up signing one
 * public key with an OTS key, and then later signing a different public
 * key with the same OTS key,  This concern was first raised by
 * https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/674.pdf in the context of Sphincs; the
 * same concern is valid here.
 *
 * This package implements optional protection against this fault attack
 * (enabled by either the FAULT_RECOMPUTE or FAULT_CACHE_SIG flags); this
 * regression test tries to hammer at it to make sure that it gives as much
 * protection as we would hope.
 *
 * Here's how this test works; if TEST_INSTRUMENTATION is enabled, then
 * we can selectively inject hash faults (currently, we have 19-21`different
 * categories of fault locations); when triggered, the corresponding
 * SHA526 hash is wrong.  What we do is generate a number of HSS signatures
 * (periodically reloading the key; a fault during a key reload needs to
 * be checked), and for each such signature, we parse it into the LMS
 * signatures, and record for each signature, what was the I value
 * (public key id), and the J index; and the value that was signed (and
 * the C randomizer).  If we ever see the same OTS private key (I and J
 * values) signing two different messages (and C randomizer), we declare
 * failure.
