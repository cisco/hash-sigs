This code attempts to be a usable implementation of the LMS Hash Based
Signature Scheme from draft-mcgrew-hash-sigs-15

This specific branch attempts to implement optional fault tolerance;
that is, no secret keying data is leaked on a miscompute.

This appears to be complete and tested.

Changes:
- Expanded the size of the private key to 64 bytes (both to add a
  checksum to detect NVRAM errors, and to include a 'max count' value
  which may be useful in key sharing
- Added a FAULT_TOLERANCE flag that, when exabled, adds checking logic
  to the public key computations; this is at some cost to both time
  and memory
- Added a fault regression test, which tests out the above protection
