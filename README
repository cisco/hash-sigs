This code attempts to be a usable implementation of the LMS Hash Based
Signature Scheme from RFC 8554.

This branch includes the SHA256/192 hashes from draft-fluhrer-lms-more-parm-sets;
currently, it does not include the SHAKE-based ones.

See read.me for documentation how to use it.

This is the ACVP branch - designed to be (optionally) compatible with the
public ACVP server
